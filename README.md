# m3u_playlist_editor_linux
Extractor (editor) for m3u-file groups (extracts 
m3u-groups from a larger file and saves the 
result in a smaller m3u-file)

## Instructions and UI
This is an m3u (playlist) editor for Linux.
You need your own m3u file to use as input.
It allows you to easily extract the groups,
you wish to use from the input file - and it
saves the result in a new m3u-file, which
is simpler (smaller and loads faster).

## Bugs
I do not promise I'll resolve reported
issues - but would like it to work on most
(or all) Linux-systems ; if you make
improvements that could benefit others,
please notify and I shall update the code.
